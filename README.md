My personal blog hosted at [swlacy.com](https://swlacy.com). Built with Hugo. Uses my own custom theme â€“ feel free to use it as you wish, though it is a little messy in terms of organization, so bear that in mind.

Clone and host locally:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lacysw/hugoblog.git
$ cd hugoblog && hugo serve
```
